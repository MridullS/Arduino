Helping Create a better kind of alert system to help deaf people and supposedly colour-blind people of the presence of another person at 
the door.


This arrangement consists of an ultrasonic sensor coupled with a RGB LED which are fixed on the breadboard. The ultrasonic Sensor is 
fixed to a distance of 10 cm wherein any person coming closer than 10 cm will send in a signal and cause the RGB LED to light up.
Special attention has been take intoconsideration that if the deaf person were also to be found colour-blind, only the BLUE/AQUA colours 
of the led will light up.

p.s.: Although not present there can be presence of tactile instruments which can help intimate the person apart fro  the LED signal.
In case the person is known to use a smartphone we can use a bluetooth to help print a message to the smartphone which can cause
the mobile to vibrate. This will help create another kind of intimation System apart fro  the primary goal of putting in a RGB LED.
