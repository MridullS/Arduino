Helping Create a better kind of alert system to help deaf people and supposedly colour-blind people of the presence of another person at 
the door.


This arrangement consists of an ultrasonic sensor coupled with a RGB LED and Bluetooth which are fixed on the breadboard. The ultrasonic Sensor is fixed to a distance of 10 cm wherein any person coming closer than 10 cm will send in a signal and cause the RGB LED to light up. Special attention has been take into consideration to make sure that if the deaf person were also to be colour-blind, only the BLUE/AQUA colours of the led would light up. In case the person is known to use a smartphone we can use a bluetooth to help print a message to the smartphone which can cause the mobile to vibrate. This will help create another kind of intimation System apart fro  the primary goal of putting in a RGB LED.


p.s.: Although not present, there can be tactile instruments which can help intimate the person, apart from the LED signal. A buzzer along with the Bluetooth message or some kind of tactile instrument to help instruct the person of someone at the door would have been a healthy addition to the model.
